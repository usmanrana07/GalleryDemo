# GalleryDemo

This is a basic sample project that shows all the media (image/video) folders from the external storage and the media inside each folder in its detail screen. I've used Kotlin, MVVM architecture and some jetpack components i.e. Navigation,LiveData, ViewModel in it. For dependency injection dagger-hilt is used. This project targets android api 33. So, it is compatible with all latest devices till date.
